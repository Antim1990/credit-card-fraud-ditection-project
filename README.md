About the Project
This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


Dataset discription
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.


Getting Started

Project Overview
The Project consists of 1 Jupyter notebooks.

One is Predictive model file where find to check which model is better perform for our project.
Second is Model deployment UI implementation file, where find to check whether transaction fraudulent or not.
Machine Learning Models Used:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Decision Tree Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier

Prerequisites
Python (>=3.6)
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries listed in requirements.txt

Installation
Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/Antim1990/credit-card-fraud-ditection-project.git

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook Prediction of Credit Card fraud.ipynb. Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
